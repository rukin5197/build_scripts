# This script is to make my life easier when building AOKP kangs. It  #
# will build for all the One V devices, but can be modified for       #
# others.                                                             #
# If you want to use this build script you will need to change quite  #
# A few things, including the DIR, sync -jx, device name, upload url, #
# etc. Have fun building!                                             #
